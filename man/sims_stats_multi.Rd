\arguments{
\item{path_sims}{The path to all apsimx output}

\item{pattern}{db extension}

\item{DT_observation}{The data.table has aggregated observations and ordered
by days}

\item{tableName}{a charater string. The name of the simulation output table
in the db}

\item{pattern_trts}{regular expression to extract the treatment names from
filename}

\item{pattern_split}{regular expression to split two treatment names}

\item{col_treatment1}{Default is the "Experiment"}

\item{col_treatment2}{Default is the "SowingDate"}

\item{mode}{three options:
\itemize{
  \item _Profile_ will calculate the soil water profile statisic.
  \item _Layers_ will calculate the stats for each layer.
  \item _Manual_ will calculate the layer by layer optimisation which will be
  the results from simulations in all combinations of all layer and possible
  kl values.
}}

\item{keys}{a character vector to define the keys for grouping. three options
  to match the mode:
\itemize{
  \item Profile mode - The default keys are "Experiment", "SimulationID", "SowingDate","KLR","RFV","SKL" for
  soil water profile.
  \item Layers mode - "Depth" should be added into the default keys.
  \item Manual mode - "Experiment", "SowingDate", "Depth" are the keys.

  }}

\item{test}{Test mode - Subset the top 3 db files in the directory to run a
test}
}
\value{
a list
}
\description{
assemble the function above to process multiple dbs
